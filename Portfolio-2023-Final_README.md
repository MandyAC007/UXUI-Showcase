## üöó Project 01: Mercedes-Benz Virtual City ‚Äì E-Commerce Platform

In 2012, Mercedes-Benz China aimed to establish its first official e-commerce platform‚Äîa landmark initiative in its automotive history. This strategic move encountered major challenges, such as low consumer recognition of automotive e-commerce and limited precedents for online car sales. Despite these obstacles, Mercedes-Benz sought to lead the digital transformation of car retail in China.

Leveraging design thinking, the team explored how to attract users, offer immersive online showroom experiences, and maintain user engagement through strong UX. Using the 5W1H model, the team analyzed user needs, timing, trust factors, and persuasive strategies for online car purchasing.

The core concept was the Mercedes-Benz Virtual City, a dynamic, rotating building metaphor that reflected Benz‚Äôs futuristic and high-tech brand essence. The UX journey was mapped through dual user entry points‚Äîintentional visitors and casual browsers‚Äîguiding them via questionnaires and tailored experiences to test drives and purchases. Data integration via the SIS system enabled one-to-one sales follow-up.

## üöô Project 02: S73 HMI UX/UI Design ‚Äì Smart Vehicle Interface Innovation

This project involved designing a next-generation in-car HMI (Human-Machine Interface) for an NEV (New Energy Vehicle) model from one of China‚Äôs top OEMs. It followed a comprehensive, human-centered design methodology structured around the phases of demand, development, and release. The team utilized workshops (Co-Discovery, Co-Creation, Co-Evaluation) to embed real user insights at every stage.

The six-month design cycle included UX research, competitor analysis, persona definition, ideation, UI design, motion graphics, and voice interface planning. A key design concept‚Äî‚ÄúFragmented Digital World‚Äù‚Äîcaptured the spirit of the Metaverse and influenced the use of dynamic animations, adaptive UI logic, and aesthetic consistency.

The interface emphasized personalization, intelligent recommendations, and a vivid digital feel through 2D/3D transitions. Final deliverables included motion-rich prototypes, UI kits, and voice design specs. The integrated design strategy, informed by trend and benchmark analysis, achieved strong client recognition and set a new standard for digital in-car experiences.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Project 03: Boeing B787-9 Training Platform ‚Äì E-Learning UX/UI Design

In early 2018, we won the UXUI design project for an internal e-learning platform dedicated to training cabin crew and flight attendants on Boeing B787-9 aircraft operations. The platform covered critical modules such as aircraft overview, emergency exits, cabin service systems, communication tools, and scene-based interactions‚Äîorganized into five comprehensive training sections.

The design was optimized for both mobile and web interfaces using H5 pages, with adaptability to WeChat Mini Programs to ensure accessibility anytime, anywhere. Our work included custom icon design for key components, enhancing clarity and intuitive navigation across training content. The solution provided China Eastern Airlines staff with a seamless digital learning experience for operational readiness and compliance.
