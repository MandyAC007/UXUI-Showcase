## 🎮 Xbox One Launch Campaign – “Start to Fun” Concept Experience

This campaign was designed to introduce Xbox One game titles in China through official promotional channels and light H5 experiences. Since the products were all game-based, the focus was less on interactivity and more on effectively delivering messaging through media and distribution channels.

The core creative direction—“Start to Fun, Let’s One Together”—was approved during the first presentation, resonating strongly with the campaign’s goal of unifying excitement and product awareness. The campaign highlighted iconic 3D characters from classic Chinese tales (e.g., Journey to the West) reimagined as game heroes, creating cultural relevance while showcasing product visuals.
